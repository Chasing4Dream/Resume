Abstract:

Plug-in electric vehicles’ charger is preferred to cover an ultrawide battery voltage range with the vehicle-to-grid capability. Conventional bidirectional resonant dc–dc converters suffer from the contradiction among wide voltage gain range, squeezed dc-link voltage span, and narrow switching frequency band. To solve the issue, a novel H5-bridge Family Series Resonant Converters are proposed in recent years. By configuring the switch pattern, the H5-bridge can form the modes of single half-bridge, dual half-bridge, half full-bridge, and dual full-bridge, respectively. Correspondingly, six gain curves can be derived. The converter achieves an ultrawide battery voltage range with a squeezed dc-link span. This seminar introduces the development of H5 bridge converters for PEV charging applications.
