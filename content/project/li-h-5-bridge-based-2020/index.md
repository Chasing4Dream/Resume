- For charging the deeply depleted battery, a wide voltage gain dc/dc converter based on LLC was proposed;
- LLC resonant converter is suitable for battery charging applications, but it has a wide voltage gain range and large conversion loss under traditional design;
- This topology uses H5 reconfigurable bridge to realize six reconfigurable modes charging.
