- The wide voltage range of the Li-ion battery challenges the 48V power supply for vehicle electrical appliances;
- Utilize full-bridge and half-bridge reconfiguration to squeeze the frequency modulation range of LLC resonant
converter under ultra-wide input voltage range, thereby improving the converter efficiency;
- Use the synchronous rectification technology based on the drain-source voltage detection method to reduce the
secondary side rectification loss.
