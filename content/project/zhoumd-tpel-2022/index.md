- Bidirectional operation comes with the application of renewable power internet with electric vehicles;
- With the variable dc-link framework, the proposed converter can work near the resonant point while adapting
to a wide battery voltage range;
- Model-based synchronous rectification reduces the loss of the rectifier during bidirectional operation;
-  Proposing bidirectional six reconfigurable switch-patterns for the H5-bridge.
